  **Design Movement**: Industrial Brutalism
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Authenticity**: Showcase the strength and durability of the coatings through bold, unrefined textures and high-contrast imagery.
  2. **Functional Clarity**: Prioritize information hierarchy with large, legible typography and clear calls to action, reflecting the "no-nonsense" nature of industrial products.
  3. **Structural Integrity**: Use grid-based layouts that mimic architectural blueprints and construction frameworks.
  4. **Materiality**: Emphasize the physical properties of the coatings (gloss, matte, texture) through close-up photography and subtle background textures.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Safety Orange (#FF6700) - Represents caution, visibility, and industrial energy.
  - **Secondary**: Concrete Grey (#808080) - Reflects the core substrate the products protect.
  - **Accent**: Deep Charcoal (#333333) - Provides strong contrast and grounding.
  - **Intent**: Evoke the feeling of a job site or manufacturing floor—rugged, reliable, and professional.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Grids**: Break away from standard centered layouts with offset columns and overlapping elements to create dynamic tension.
  - **Split Screens**: Use vertical or horizontal splits to compare "before" and "after" states or to juxtapose product shots with application environments.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Technical Data Overlays**: Use monospace fonts for specs and data points, styled like technical schematics.
  - **Diagonal Stripes**: Incorporate hazard stripe patterns as subtle background elements or dividers.
  - **Heavy Borders**: Use thick, solid borders for buttons and image containers to suggest durability.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons should have a "heavy" feel, perhaps with a slight depression effect on click.
  - **Hover Reveals**: Hovering over product images could reveal technical specs or application diagrams.

  **Animation**:
  - **Staggered Entrances**: Elements slide in with a heavy, mechanical ease-out curve.
  - **Glitch Effects**: Subtle glitch transitions on hover to reinforce the industrial/tech vibe.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Chakra Petch** (Square, technical sans-serif) - Bold and uppercase for impact.
  - **Body**: **Roboto Mono** (Monospace) - For technical details and specs.
  - **Body Alternative**: **Inter** (Clean sans-serif) - For long-form text to ensure readability.

  **Design Movement**: Clean Modernism / "Lab Chic"
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Scientific Precision**: Highlight the chemical engineering and advanced technology behind the coatings.
  2. **Purity & Protection**: Use a clean, white-dominant palette to suggest hygiene, safety, and the pristine finish of the products.
  3. **Visual Clarity**: Use ample whitespace to let the product images and color samples breathe.
  4. **Trust & Expertise**: Convey authority through professional, understated design elements.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Lab White (#FFFFFF) - The canvas for showcasing the product's transformative power.
  - **Secondary**: Chemical Blue (#007BFF) - Represents science, trust, and water-based technologies.
  - **Accent**: Silver/Chrome (#C0C0C0) - Adds a touch of premium quality and reflection.
  - **Intent**: Position "Best Choice" as the scientifically superior option for protective coatings.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Cards**: Organize content into clean, floating cards with soft shadows.
  - **Centralized Focus**: Use centered layouts for hero sections to draw attention to the core value proposition.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Glassmorphism**: Use frosted glass effects for overlays and navigation to suggest transparency and modern coating finishes.
  - **Circular Motifs**: Use circles for icons and image masks to represent liquid droplets and molecular structures.
  - **Clean Lines**: Thin, precise dividers and borders.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smooth Transitions**: All interactions should be fluid and seamless, mimicking the flow of liquid coatings.
  - **Soft Shadows**: Hover states increase elevation with soft, diffused shadows.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fade-ins**: Content gently fades in and floats up.
  - **Liquid Motion**: Background elements or decorative blobs move with a slow, liquid-like animation.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Montserrat** (Geometric sans-serif) - Clean, modern, and versatile.
  - **Body**: **Open Sans** (Humanist sans-serif) - Friendly and highly legible.

  **Design Movement**: Bold Commercial / "Big Box" Professional
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Retail Confidence**: Mimic the bold, accessible style of major home improvement brands to build instant familiarity.
  2. **Value & Action**: Emphasize pricing, "Buy Now" buttons, and clear value propositions.
  3. **Product Heroism**: Make the product packaging and application results the undisputed stars of the page.
  4. **Direct Communication**: Use punchy headlines and bullet points for quick scanning.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Best Choice Red (#D32F2F) - Urgent, bold, and attention-grabbing (similar to the original Simiron red but adjusted).
  - **Secondary**: Dark Navy (#1A237E) - Professional, trustworthy, and corporate.
  - **Accent**: Bright Yellow (#FFEB3B) - Used sparingly for "New" tags or sale highlights.
  - **Intent**: Create a high-energy, sales-driven environment that feels like a trusted industry leader.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Full-Width Sections**: Alternate background colors for full-width sections to break up content.
  - **Grid of Goods**: Classic e-commerce grids for product listings to maximize browsing efficiency.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Bold Badges**: "Best Seller", "New Formula", "Pro Choice" badges on product cards.
  - **Hero Carousels**: Large, sliding banners showcasing different applications (garage, industrial, etc.).
  - **Iconography**: Simple, bold icons for features (e.g., "Fast Dry", "Low VOC").

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap & Click**: Interactions should feel snappy and responsive.
  - **Zoom on Hover**: Product images zoom slightly on hover to show detail.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide-ins**: Content slides in from the side or bottom.
  - **Pulse**: "Buy Now" buttons might have a subtle pulse effect to draw attention.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Oswald** (Condensed sans-serif) - Tall and bold, great for headlines and maximizing space.
  - **Body**: **Lato** (Sans-serif) - Balanced and neutral for descriptions.
